B0XX Button Holds
These are the different B0XX Modes entered by holding the respective buttons WHILE plugging the controller in.  Toggles save the last mode used and swaps between them if button is held once again while plugging in.
 
When plugged into anything:
Start - Forces Melee mode and skip polling rate detection.
CLeft + B - Enters/Forces Project M Mode (No other buttons allowed to be held on right side to reduce accidental mode entering)
 
When plugged into a GC/Wii:
Melee mode is entered by default.
L - Toggles ModX/Y + L performing analog or digital shield (digital is the default and recommended mode)
 
When plugged into a Wii U/Switch Adapter (Mayflash or Official only):
Ultimate mode is entered by default.
Left + Right - Toggles analog stick SOCD override reactivation.
 
When plugged into a computer:
Melee mode is entered by default
ModX - Enters RoA mode.
ModY - Enters Keyboard mode.
ModY + ModX/A/CUp - Changes keyboard mode's Up, Down, Left, and Right buttons to arrow keys.  Pressing ModX/A/CUp changes which key(s) functions as the up key (multiple/any combination can be used).  Note: CUp will make Up function as Up arrow key (CUp is just used since it is easier to press in combination with ModY).  
Example 1:  ModY + ModX = ModX is the up arrow key, and down, left and right are their respective arrow keys.  
Example 2: ModY + ModX + CUp = ModX AND Up function as the up arrow key, and down, left and right are their respective arrow keys.
ModY + CDown - Changes keyboard mode back to default abcde... mode (No arrow keys).


You should wavedash with down + left / right + mod x + L


Buffered method (2 examples):
- When on a platform, dash, hold shield (L) and (while still holding Left/Right) press Down to shield drop.

- When you land from an aerial, hold L or Z + Left/Right during L cancel lag, then press Down. It's preferable to use L in case your shield is hit.

To shield drop from a standing position:
- Slight shield tilt method: Shield with L + Mod X and hold Left/Right, release the mod after 4 or more frames, then press Down.

- Straight down method: Shield with L + Mod X and hold Down, then release the mod after 4 or 5 frames (if you wait any longer to release Mod X it won't work).

Note: Shield dropping from a light shield works the same as from a regular shield, only that you use LS/MS rather than L.

To Sheild Drop from a stand-still:
   Hold L+R > Press Left / Right > Let go of R while still holding the direction + L > Press Down


Pivot > Stop:
   Left > Right > Mod X (really fast)

The B0XX updater relies on avrdude.exe. If it isn't working in Windows 10, you can get this from downloading Adruino IDE. The default install path is:
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\tools\avr\bin

copy the files in that folder to the same path as where avrdude is in the B0XX updater

Pivot:
Any of the following methods:
Left → Right → release Right on the next frame
Left → Right → press Mod X or Mod Y on the next frame
Left → Right → Down Right on the next frame




Dash Back Out of Crouch: You are forced to release Down and press Back by frame 2.
