        - once update is finished, turn off bluetooth headset
        - in windows 10 bluetooth settings, remove "Bose NC 700 HP" device
        - restart windows 10 machine
        - open bluetooth and other devices
        - hold power button on bose headset to put in pairing mode
        - in windows 10, add bluetooth device
        - add bose 700r
