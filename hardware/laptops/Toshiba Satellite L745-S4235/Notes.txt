      Drive Type        Hard Disk Drive         This defines whether the drive is a large-capacity slower hard disk drive, a smaller-capacity but much faster solid-state drive, or a hybrid
      Physical Size     2.5"                    The size of the drive dictates which drive bays it will fit into - generally a small drive will fit into any bigger drive bay with an adapter
      Capacity          640GB                   The drive storage capacity is the limit to the size of files that can be stored
      Release Date      30 Mar 2011             The later the release, the more likely manufacturer support will still be around
      Cache Size        8MB                     The bigger the cache, the more data that can be temporarily stored for faster access
      Power Required    5W                      HDDs should generally require very little power to run, and SSDs even less
      RPM               5400 RPM                The higher the RPM, the faster the hard drive, and the faster stored data can be accessed
      Drive Interface   SATA 3Gb/s (SATA II)    The interface is the type of motherboard connection and defines the bandwidth limit of the drive
