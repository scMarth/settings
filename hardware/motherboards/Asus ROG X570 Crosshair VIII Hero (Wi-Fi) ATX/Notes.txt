      Section 2.3 Motherboard rear and audio connections - In the picture at the beginning of this section, it shows that the WiFi-antenna also connects to the Bluetooth.

      I was having issues with my PS4 controller disconnecting until I plugged in the Wi-Fi antenna. It seems that this antenna doubles as the Bluetooth antenna as well. Without the antenna, the Bluetooth connection seems unreliable / unstable.
