if you need to install TurboTax, but it is saying that MSVCP140.dll not found, and are still getting that error even when installing the x64 version of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package, try installing the x86 version:

        You need to install the x86 version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package that the TurboTax developers forgot to include in the TurboTax installation software.
