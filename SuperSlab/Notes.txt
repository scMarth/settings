For Slippi:

    Use profile 1 (GCC with Melee coordinates) & make sure you don't have an adapter plugged into your PC at the same time, as the Slab won't work in that case. The polling rate for this is 1000hz. 

    Slippi setup steps:
        - plug in Superslab without any button holds (by default, Melee mode will be used)
        - set port 1 (or whatever) to GameCube Adapter for Wii U

by default top left small black button is start


Accessing the Settings Page

1. While pressing and holding any one of the menu buttons (M1-M6), connect the
Superslab to a computer using the provided USB-A to USB-C cable.
Note: When the board is properly connected in the Slab Settings Page state, a
purple light animation will appear. The profile currently being edited will be
illuminated white.

2. Open a web browser on the computer.
3. In the browser's address bar, navigate to 192.168.120.240
