Teacher's Pet
    Choco-sensei asks you to take a general knowledge quiz! If you get it right, there may be a reward, but if you don't...

        Let's try it!
            Q. Smallest prefecture in Japan?
            A. Kagawa!
                Chocolate Kiss + 300 pekos

Devilish Prank
    Towa walks up to you, carrying a bag of money you've never seen before. She says she found it lying on the floor close by, and is wondering if it's yours.

    Claim the bag
        - got Bibi Replica (+more damage every second you go unharmed)
        - 

    Tell the truth!
        - + 100 pekos


Omikuji
    Push the button
        - You pulled a four. That's a big curse... a wave of intense dreaad washes over you, making you feel weak.

Impersonation Test:
    1 "I'm the real Houshou Marine"
        It was Kanata: + 30 max health
    2 "I know you'll choose me! I'll trust you!"
    3 "Ahooy! I'm the actual one!"
    4 "You love senchou, don't you? It's me!"
        4th choice = Matsuri / + 100 health

        + extra Onion
    

Nut-rition:
    The witch of nuts, Ayunda, visits you in the dead of night! She asks you what your favorite nut is.

        Walnuts: you now take less damage from enemy attacks
        Cashew nuts: those are her favorite! regain all health, deal more damage, enemies take less damage
        Chestnuts: you will now deal more damage to enemies
        Coconuts: she gets disappointed (no effect)
