    navigate to the desired game

    play a bit on the computer with the save files that you want to keep

    make sure that after playing, the save files in the cloud for that game are updated, if not:

    right-click the game on all computers > properties > local files > verify integrity of game files...
        do this on all computers, sometimes, one file or more files being corrupted will cause the cloud sync to fail for that device
