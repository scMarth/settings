## Troubleshooting

_These themes works with Sublime Text 3 and hasn't been tested on earlier versions._

**1) Font descenders are cut off in the file UI tabs**

Apply this setting to your "Settings - User" file.
`"gravity_tab_font_small": true`

**2) The "Find" feature appears to be hidden behind the status bar.**

When switching themes in Sublime Text, it will retain the height for the Find bar set in the previous theme. Sometimes this will cause the bar to appear hidden behind the status bar.

[To fix, simply grab the bar and pull-up.](https://github.com/frankyonnetti/gravity-sublime-theme/wiki/Theme-Trouble-Shooting)

**3) Missing sidebar icons.**

Installing and switching themes in Sublime Text may cause some sidebar icons to not show. Disabling installed/inactive themes via Package Control should fix the issue.
